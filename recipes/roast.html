        <h2>The best roast you will ever have!</h2>
        <p>Mississippi Pot Roast is a combination of five simple ingredients that all cook together in your slow cooker. It is typically made with a chuck roast, which is inexpensive and easy to find at most grocery stores. You can also makes this with other cuts of meat.</p>
        <p>All of the ingredients you will need are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3-4 lbs.) Chuck roast</li>
            <li>1 packet ranch dressing mix</li>
            <li>1 packet au jus gravy mix</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>4-5 pepperoncini peppers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place roast in the slow cooker and sprinkle the top with the ranch dressing mix and the au jus mix. Place peppers on top of the mixes, and add dallops of butter on top.</li>
            <li>Cook over low heat for 8 hours. Serve over noodles, rice or mashed potatoes (my favorite).</li>
        <h2>Important:</h2>    
        <p>Do not add any water or broth to this. It will create enough broth while cooking.</p>
        </ol>
